# Recruitment API

This project implements a simple Recruitment API using AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit). The API provides two endpoints, one for handling `GET` requests and another for `POST` requests. Both endpoints are integrated with AWS Lambda functions written in TypeScript, with the infrastructure defined and deployed using AWS CDK.
